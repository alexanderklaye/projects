This project was made in android studio

The goal was to allow a user to create favourite locations that they could look up using the Google Maps api.

It uses a recycler view to list the favourites, and tapping on the item to have it appear in a maps window. The location is then drawn along with the user's current location, and draws a line on the map between the two locations.
